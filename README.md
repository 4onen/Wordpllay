# Wordpllay

**Wordpllay** is an interactive game to play with a large language model.

You, the user, are given some set of secret words. Your goal is to convince the
AI to say these words (even as parts of larger words) without saying the words
in your prompt to the AI. Sounds simple? It's really not.

You're given about an old SMS message's worth of characters to prompt the AI,
and the AI can generate up to 100 tokens of response. Each attempt is oneshot,
with no pre-existing conversation.
